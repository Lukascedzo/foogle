        Instructions:
        Prepare the pizza dough: In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let it sit for 5 minutes until frothy.
        In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, olive oil, salt, and the yeast mixture. Stir until a dough forms.
        Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.
        Preheat your oven to the highest temperature setting (usually around 475°F or 245°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat.
        Punch down the risen dough and divide it into two equal portions. Roll out each portion into a round pizza crust.
        Place the pizza crusts on a lightly floured surface or pizza peel.
        Spread tomato sauce evenly over each pizza crust, leaving a small border around the edges.
        Arrange slices of fresh mozzarella cheese on top of the sauce.
        Tear fresh basil leaves and scatter them over the cheese. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
        Drizzle olive oil over the pizzas.
        If using a pizza stone, carefully transfer the pizzas onto the preheated stone. Otherwise, place the pizzas on a baking sheet.
        Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and melted.

        With the food processor running, gradually pour in the olive oil until the mixture is smooth and well combined. If needed, add more olive oil to reach your desired consistency.

        In a large skillet, heat the pesto sauce over medium heat. Add the cooked pasta to the skillet and toss until evenly coated with the sauce. If the sauce is too thick, you can add some of the reserved pasta water to thin it out.
